          Assignments
            Split into 2 parts left and right
            Evaluate right
            Place results of right evalution into left ID

            Assign, ID(var), Eq, Either(Literal, Identifer, FilterChain)
            First run Preprocessor to convert identifiers to values
            Second evaluate the value after the Eq
            Add the var key to the ctx hashtable

          Filter Evaluation
            From left to right evalutate filters
            Take this example
            {% assign animal = "horse" %}
            {{ animal | capitalize | slice: 2 }}
            First the Preprocessor is run
            "horse" | capitalize | slice: 2
            Second the first filter is evaluated
            "Horse" | slice: 2
            Third the final filter is evaluates
            "rse"
            This value is returned
